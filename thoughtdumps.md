**Braindumps** are my word for free-form dumping **anything and everything** I think of. I allow my mind to wander to whatever it wants and I write what comes **naturally**. 

You can consider braindumping a form of meditation but it can also help you better understand what you are thinking about.

Braindumps can be:
- **Written** on paper or on the computer. This is the most common type.
- **Recorded** with a microphone or phone. Talking out loud can have just as strong of an effect as writing it down.
- **Imagined** in your mind like a mental conversation with yourself. If you can visualize yourself having a conversation with another person, this can be a very powerful way to think/talk through something that is bothering you.

The Value of Braindumps:
- **Organize** your thoughts. By regurgitating all of your thoughts, you can better organize them.
- **Remember** details you thought you had forgot. Going through an event from start to end will help your mind recall lost information.
- **Discover** new details or knowledge you didn't realize you knew. Braindumping a memory can help you find new information or come to new conclusions without emotions getting in the way.

More importantly, Braindumps are **fun and easy**!

You don't need to spend time _thinking_ about what you want to write, you just write whatever comes into your brain (hence the name braindump). 

There is no _guide_ or _right way_. Just pick a method and **go!**

When starting out, I recommend setting aside quite a lot of time - especially if you have a lot on your mind. Braindumps often take a while and can unlock new thoughts that you have to work through. I have had braindumps that lasted a few minutes and a braindump that lasted several hours. 

I have taken the liberty to write a small example braindump based on my day at the time of writing this:
> I woke up like normal but felt that I was that weird combination of tired yet, oddly, more awake than usual. Not thinking much of it, I rolled out of bed and shuffled into my office with my blanket in toe. I snoozed extra today so I didnt have time to clean up and just opened my work laptop. Working from home has many benefits. Being able to _go to_ work by just going to a different room is one of them. ...

Before starting to write this I didn't actually remember how I woke up or what I was feeling at the time but, the moment I started typing, it all came flooding back to me. This works for almost anything. I have even found that it will work for something that I didn't pay that much attention to.

For example, just today at work, I was asked to summarize a topic that I wasn't paying attention to because my ADHD was acting up and I was hyper-focusing on a different topic. When I was asked to summarize I was honest and said that I missed most of it. A few minutes later I decided to perform a quick braindump of the topic and suddenly everything came back to me. I was able to recall what I already knew from when I was paying attention and I was also able to extract a few details from the conversation when I wasn't paying attention. I then realized that I actually could summarize the topic and all it took was about 2 minutes of braindumping. 

**No this isnt a super power.** Don't think that I am trying to convince you that this is some sort of super power or new, undiscovered, way of recalling information. This is actually very normal and is already a common practice for many people who take notes after a presentation or write daily journals.

Writing braindumps are so successful that some people also use it as a technique to lucid dream more regularly and successfully. Just do a quick Google search if you don't believe me.

The bottom line is that clearing your head and expressing your thoughts through some medium (writing, talking, etc.) is very good for your **mental health** and can massively help with **productivity.** At the extreme end, braindumps can be so successful that you feel like a new person the next day. On any given day, braindumps can help keep your thoughts clear, uncluttered, and right at the tip of your toungue.
