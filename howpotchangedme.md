# Intro

This is a somewhat wordy chronicling of my journey from an emotional wreck to a somewhat stable person through the use of weed.

Anxiety, ADHD, a mess of emotions, and boredom that I didn't have a handle on was the story of my life for such a long time that I thought it was normal. 

I don't know what lead me to be this way. I assume that it was a culmination of a lot of small bad decisions over my life thus far. 

For my entire life, I played it safe and avoided situations that I felt would be uncomfortable - I don't think I have to tell you why this is a bad idea.

Sure, at first this seems like an obviously good thing but I definitely took it to extremes. I was one of those kids that made it through college without going to a _single_ party. I'm serious - not a single one. And no, it wasn't because I was studying hard to be top in class. I was inside playing games until the wee hours of the morning. 

For some reason, I always assumed someone would try to take advantage of me, make fun of me, or that I would be put into uncomfortable situations. I also had an assumption that people would try to push drugs on me and that I would have a "blackout" or something. I blame the weird anti-drug programs that schools ran (the DARE program I believe) and the "Meth. Not even once." commercials.

So I graduated from college without going to a party, getting _any_ girlfriends, not experimenting with vices, or anything even remotely interesting.

To sum it up frankly, I was a **loser**.

At first, I was proud of this (well not the girlfriend part) and would even brag about it. I always told people that I knew how to say no to people whenever I wanted and was never burdened with things I didn't want to do.

As nice as avoiding all responsibilities and a social life is, it makes life  _really_ boring, unfulfilling, and just meh all around.


# The Punishing Side of Being a "No" Man
Get it? Like the opposite of a yes man?

Anyways, saying no is great and all but my oh my does it have some drastic downsides. 

Here is a "short" list to name a few:
- Poor friendships
- Little to no network
- No one to help with **anything** (need to move? Have fun lifting that couch by yourself)
- No one to ask advice (have fun searching the internet for that one correct article instead of talking to someone that's actually done it and can **show** you in person.)
- Bad moods from lack of socializing
- Little to no life experiences to think back on (this is surprisingly awful and can make getting old suck)
- No experiences to talk about with people (experiences are a great way to break the ice, relate to others, and get to know people)
- Self-consciousness and self-doubt (lots of it)
- A feeling that something is wrong
- A lack of opportunities to take advantage of (you need to go outside occasionally for some of the great opportunities that successful people find.)
- Gradual accumulation of mental stress (feeling stressed even though nothing is going on?)
- Emotional dampening (ever been told that you don't react to things or that you are boring?)


Honestly, the list just goes on, but, for readability, I will stop there (that's a lot of commas).

The biggest thing for me is that I **never** actually felt like I decompressed at the end of the day. Even though I was always doing something relaxing, I was never actually relaxed.

I was always in a constant state of anxiety. Occasionally, something *extra* would happen and some other emotions would leak through but I always felt like my mind was muddled. This was bad enough that even my memories, while vivid, usually include some element of brain fog (weird right?).

Now the strange thing is that I had no idea I was feeling this way. It was just "how it had always been." At some point, I had gone from an energetic kid to a reserved, anxious one and I didn't even realize it.

# Introducing the good kush
Er - weed.

If you had told the 18-year-old me that I would "give in" (again those dang DARE programs) and start ingesting pot then I would have been very confused and probably alarmed.

So, how did I start?

After weed was legalized in my state and, after a few months, someone close to me offered me a few gummies.

Initially, I was hesitant because I had been hard-wired to turn down all drugs no matter what - but I knew that the stigma around it was changing so I *relented*.

Pardon me for being dramatic but my god did it have an effect.

For the first time in what felt like literally my whole life, I finally relaxed. Everything that I had bottled up was released in one fell swoop. I **never** experienced anything like it - not even with alcohol. 

It was like I was finally able to express myself and just enjoy the moment. No thinking about later, no worrying about what people thought, no worrying about missing out or wasting time, **just pure relaxation**.

That first time is what woke me up - *I'm so sorry about that pun I just couldn't resist*.

Everything I have written was realizations I made post-first-gummy. Finally being able to decompress made me realize just how tense and pent up I was. I realized that I was living my life through how I thought others would react and was never actually taking my mind off of things.


# Relief from Anxiety and ADHD
This deserves its own section because of how impactful it was.

Anytime I did anything, thoughts like these would run through my head:
- What if they don't like it?
- What if I make someone uncomfortable?
- What if they don't like me?
- What if I can't relate to them?
- What if they think I am weird?
- What if they think I am fat?
- What if they think I'm ugly?

You get the picture... definitely not a healthy mindset. You would be amazed at much anxiety I had just because of those thoughts.

Yeah well, most of that is gone now. I now understand that I need to start living for the moment and need to stop worrying about the future. In fact, it comes more naturally to me now to not worry as much. I'm not sure if it's a temporary change but I hope it's here to stay.

Did you know that anxiety can lead to [health problems](https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety/effects-on-body#:~:text=Anxiety%20disorders%20can%20cause%20rapid,the%20risk%20of%20coronary%20events.)? I'm not saying that I had all of these issues but I definitely had some of them. In fact, I have been struggling with stomach issues for a few months, and wouldn't you know it, it's getting better all of the sudden. Coincidence or.. ?

Ok, so now to talk about ADHD. Let me tell you that I did not realize just how much ADHD controlled my life. I had everything from hyper-focusing to not being able to focus on anything at all. In fact, I read [this health article](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/adult-adhd/symptoms-causes/syc-20350878) on ADHD and realized that I struggled with **literally everything** that was mentioned in some way or another.

I'm not sure why, but, once I had a gummy, it was like my ADHD was suppressed and, not just during the high, but also after. Don't get me wrong, it's not cured or anything. But I now am a lot more conscious of it and have more control over it than I ever did.

It helped me realize just how much it affected me and it was a genuine shock for me. 

So in essence, eating a gummie both allowed me to release decades of anxiety and stress AND also helped me get my ADHD under control. This was enough to sell me on it and make me a regular.


# Wrap Up
So there you have it. 
Emotional Wreck Me + Weed = Emotionally Stable and Happy Me. (this is an official calculation)

So is the takeaway that I should just go off the deep end and consume weed every day? 

Oh, If life were so simple - No.

Downsides of weed:
- Gets expensive quickly (40$ for an average container of gummies and only has like 10 or 20 gummies depending on potency)
- Tolerance increases over time with frequent consumption (combined with the first point and it starts to get out of hand quickly)
- Can't drive (you really shouldn't anyway)
- Not great for going out into public (might also be straight-up illegal to do so)
- Can make you tired (depending on strain)
- Food cravings out the wahzoo and related weight gains (supposedly depends on strain but I always get the munchies no matter what)
- Lack of scientific research (basically there could be side effects we don't know about)
- Negative stigma (its changing but habits die hard)
- Not federally legal (could be taken away or punished at any time - although I doubt that will happen)
- Effectively makes you a non-functioning member of society. (If I'm getting high, then I am watching movies, listening to music, or playing games)
- Lastly, becoming too reliant on it and not being able to function without it.

Now admittedly I did have to stretch a bit to think of those downsides but I think they are valid. 

So how much will I indulge?

I plan to just play it by ear. I only buy one container at a time which makes me have to get off my lazy butt and get more if I really want it. This acts as a sort of control for me. I have also told my friends and family to cut me off if it looks like I'm going off the deep end.

At my peak, I did it daily for about two weeks but then I took a week or two off. To be fair to me it was new and I was experimenting with the different strains and potencies. I imagine I will find a happy medium like only doing it on weekends or limiting it to only a few days a week.

Now, this is not a definitive argument for or against the usage of weed. There is a very strong chance that I was simply ready for change and weed is what helped me move across the line so to speak. Until such a time that weed is proved to have medical benefits, I would think of it more as a healthier alternative to getting drunk. You can pretty much apply the same rules for drinking beer as consuming weed. 

At the end of the day I had friends and family pushing me to be better and, with their help, I was able to come out of my shell and recover from a low in my life.

I look forward to what life has to offer now that I am more open-minded and less controlled by anxiety/ADHD.

# Some time later (Updated on 11/21/2021)

It has been a few weeks now and I have come to a few new conclusions.

Firstly, my tolerance has increased at a rate that makes eating gummies far less worth it. Each gummie is roughly $2-4 depending on the strength. Thats fine if it only takes one or two but now it takes like four to achieve anything close to the same effect.

I also found that even if I could achieve a decent high, it was never as good as the first few times. I would take the gummies and wait in anticipation only to not feel anything or to feel only slightly *buzzed*? I don't know the weed alternative to buzzed. 

Because of these reasons I decided to take a long break from it until a time comes again that I need it. 

So basically it will be a monthly or bi-monthly indulgence as apposed to daily or weekly.
