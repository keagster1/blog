title: "Dealing with Bias in the Mind"

We are all predisposed to view the world a certain way. Most of this comes from what we experience in life but we all also seem to be born with a bias towards acting a certain way. 

Some of us are inquisitive, some are excitable, some are lazy, and so on. If a person never reflects on how they view the world, they may never change from these views. In other words, their mentality would land on thinking one way and never change.

If you have ever heard the phrase **"You can't teach an old dog new tricks"** this is essentially the same thing.

This is nothing special and somewhat well known. 

What interests me, is what happens when you realize what your biases are and, how you react to it. For example, I realized that I am lazy, defensive, have thin skin, and have anxiety issues. 

Many questions ran through my mind when I first decided to confront my biases: 
- How do I react now that I know that? 
- Can I even fix these issues? 
- Do I need to?
- Maybe I can start creating daily goals to change this?
- Maybe I talk to a therapist?
- Or can I simply decide to not be that way anymore?
- We all live life through habits so maybe I can just change the habits of my mind? 

For me, these questions signaled that I had just taken an important step. I realized that these questions were all driven by curiosity and a desire for change. I realized that in asking these questions and reflecting on them, I had actually changed - in a way, I had evolved the mind...

So now for new questions:
- If I have changed, do I still have the same biases?
- Are biases even rooted that deeply or are they more like suggestions that form according to our desires at the time? 
- My desire changed, so does that mean my biases changed?

In order to determine if I had actually changed, I did what most people do when they are inspired... I made a list of goals.

I realized that I had issues that were preventing me from being the best version of me. I wanted to change but as I was writing my goals down I realized that I had a hundered different things that I wanted to improve. I did this as part of a braindumping excercise which you can read more about in my blog post [The Practice of Braindumps](http://localhost:3000/posts/thoughtdumps).

I couldn't solve everything so I challenged myself. I picked one of the traits I didn't like about myself and set out to fix it. The trait I chose for this challenge was my defensiveness. My new goal would be to take feedback and jokes without trying to defend myself. Instead I'm going to welcome it and assume good intent.

I tried this out for a month - the results?

It went pretty well actually. I wasn't perfect and I found that it is very difficult to assume good intent when you are on the recieving end of a comment that is not obviously a joke. 

My biggest take away was to talk less and listen more. I found that when I wasn't scrambling to interject with my own thoughts, there were less times when I would misinterpret something. Instead of reacting to everything right away I now take a few seconds to process it and wait for the burst of emotion that surges inside of me to calm down. 

Emotions really do hijack our minds. It's amazing how different our actions are when our emotions take over. We are far more unwilling to learn or be wrong. Emotions have a tendancy to feed off of itself and become worse. For example, if you are having a bad day, you will begin to view every bump in the road as the universe being out to get you. 

*Emotions make everything about you, when in reality, it almost never is.*
